# Simple Web UI for Analytics

The goal of this task is to provide a simple ui to answer specific business questions? 

What are the questions?

* What is the most purchased item on the menu and also how many times was it purchased by all
customers?
  
* Display the sales date specifying purchases which were made by members on that date or not and
the ranking of their purchases based on the order date
  
### Instructions to run the code : -

* Clone this repository, or you can download the files from here. 
  The assumption is that a csv file will be used to load data into the database
* Open up a terminal and running the following commands
    * `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    * `python main.py`
    * We needed to create the information in the tables first before dashboard run will be successful
* The UI should be available on http://127.0.0.1:8050/
